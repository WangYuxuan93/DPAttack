# DPAttack (TODO: Reconstruction code)

Code for ACL 2020 Paper: Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Neural Network-based Dependency Parsing Models with Adversarial Examples, [URL](https://acl2020.org/).

# Requirement:
Python: 3.7

PyTorch: 1.4.0

# Acknowledgement

The implementation is based on [yzhangcs](https://github.com/yzhangcs)'s code in https://github.com/yzhangcs/biaffine-parser. Thanks for his implementation of "Deep Biaffine Attention for Neural Dependency Parsing". 

The nlpaug libary is based on [makcedward](https://github.com/makcedward)'s libary in https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug, a python libray for data augmentation in NLP. Thanks for their awesome library.
